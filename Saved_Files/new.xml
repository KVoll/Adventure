        Consciousness slowly returns to you after a very unnatural slumber. You feel your eyes open as panic sends your
        mind into an adrenaline fueled search of your last memory. You take deep breaths trying to calm yourself from
        the initial flood of panic. As your mind races you slowly come to terms that you have no recollection of the
        events that transpired before you woke. In fact, you fail to remember anything. Your eyes dart around the room
        in an attempt to find some kind of solution to the riddle of where and who you are.

    </tip><room name="unknown room"><desc>      The room is completely foreign to you.  There's no telling how long you've been unconscious. Days? Weeks?\n
        Months?  You're uncertain.  The only choice you have is to try to find answers.  Try to find a way out.  The\n
        truly unfortunate thing is that your capabilities are rendered.  You only know how to look, open, and take\n
        the artifacts around you.  The first thing you do is carefully inspect your surroundings.\n
        There's a bookshelf, the bed that you woke up on, a large metal door, and a desk.\n
        </desc><l>You notice that the room is furnished with dusty antiques.  The only light source is coming from thin paneled
        windows with bars on them.  You take a moment to get more familiar with the room you're in.</l><o>You go to the metal door and try to escape.  To no surprise, the metal door is locked.  For a moment you
              contemplated the possibility of the windows being a way out.  It's not long before you realize that even if
              you got the bars off, you wouldn't fit through the tiny slit anyway.  Ultimately, your attempts to open the
              room have failed.</o><t>Knowing how to perform only three actions must be taking it's toll on your intelligence.  After hours of
              struggling with your pockets you finally come to the conclusion that your pants were made too tight to fit a
              room inside of them. You give up, and stop trying to take the room.</t><UNKNOWN_OBJECT_TYPE>([&lt;Q2API_XML.creepy.desc_q2class object at 0x02D40730&gt;, &lt;Q2API_XML.creepy.l_q2class object at 0x02D40750&gt;, &lt;Q2API_XML.creepy.o_q2class object at 0x02D40770&gt;, &lt;Q2API_XML.creepy.t_q2class object at 0x02D40790&gt;, &lt;Q2API_XML.creepy.item_q2class object at 0x02D407B0&gt;, &lt;Q2API_XML.creepy.item_q2class object at 0x02D40B30&gt;, &lt;Q2API_XML.creepy.item_q2class object at 0x02D4E490&gt;, &lt;Q2API_XML.creepy.item_q2class object at 0x02D4E550&gt;], (&lt;type 'exceptions.Exception'&gt;, ValueError('XML Node object does not have expected data &lt;You found a history point!
