    Consciousness slowly returns to you after a very unnatural slumber. You feel your eyes open as panic sends your mind
    into an adrenaline fueled search of your last memory. You take deep breaths trying to calm yourself from the
    initial flood of panic. As your mind races you slowly come to terms that you have no recollection of the events that
    transpired before you woke. In fact, you fail to remember anything. Your eyes dart around the room in an attempt to
    find some kind of solution to the riddle of where and who you are.

    </tip><room name="unknown room"><desc>         The room is completely foreign to you.  There's no telling how long you've been unconscious. Days? Weeks?
         Months?  You're uncertain.  The only choice you have is to try to find answers.  Try to find a way out.  The
         truly unfortunate thing is that your capabilities are rendered.  You only know how to look, open, and take
         the artifacts around you.  The first thing you do is carefully inspect your surroundings.  There's a bookshelf,
         the bed that you woke up on, a large metal door, and a desk.
        </desc><l>You notice that the room is furnished with dusty antiques.  The only light source is coming from thin
                      paneled windows with bars on them.  You take a moment to get more familiar with the room you're in.</l><o>You go to the metal door and try to escape.  To no surprise, the metal door is locked.  For a moment you
              contemplated the possibility of the windows being a way out.  It's not long before you realize that even if
              you got the bars off, you wouldn't fit through the tiny slit anyway.  Ultimately, your attempts to open the
              room have failed.</o><t>Knowing how to perform only three actions must be taking it's toll on your intelligence.  After hours of
              struggling with your pockets you finally come to the conclusion that your pants were made too tight to fit a
              room inside of them. You give up, and stop trying to take the room.</t><item obtainable="0" type="desk" inspected="0"><visible in="unknown room"></visible><l> The desk is aged and brittle probably made out of wood.  You're afraid to touch it in fear it might fall
                   apart.  Dust and thick spiderwebs are covering the surface.  It must have been here for a long time to
                   collect that much buildup.  You start to fade away into a daydream, and for a moment everything goes black.
                   When the light reappears, you notice you've drawn a symbol into the dust.  You stare at it until the image
                   is etched in your mind.
            </l><o>You hesitated for a moment because the thing feels unsteady.  The last thing you want is for it to fall
               apart.  Whoever has kept you here might be upset.  Who DOES have you here, you wonder.  Eventually you
               opened the drawers slowly as the desk trembled.</o><t>Your attempts are futile, poor thing.  The second you got your arms around it the whole thing shifted and
              almost fell on top of you.  You're lucky you're still alive.</t><item obtainable="1" type="journal" inspected="0"><visible in="desk"></visible><requirement req="key"><prereq>&lt;The journal is locked.

                      you're eyes are focused on the symbol engraved in the leather.  It appears to be the as the one that
                      appeared on the desk.</l><o>I started to go through the journal and saw a lot of meaningless things written.  It seems like the
                  owner was a scientist of sorts.  It wasn't until I got to the last page that I saw something
                  interesting.  It reads,

                                                "WANT OUT OF HERE?

                       and a little boy posing for a happy picture. Unfortunately, you don't know who the two boys are.
                       At that moment you recall seeing your reflection in the window.  It wasn't long before you
                       realized that the woman in the picture is me. You took a moment to inspect the picture further
                       and found something strange on the back. There is a small note stuck to it.
                    </l><o>You try to use the picture in an futile attempt to spark some memories.  The attempt ultimately
                          failed.</o><t>You decide that even though you don't know the men in this picture, you'd like to hold on to it
                           in case you do gain some memories.</t><item obtainable="1" type="note" inspected="0"><visible in="picture"></visible><l>You look at the note stuck to the back of the picture with speculation.  Why did someone

It was meant to stay hidden.  </l><o> </o><t> </t></item></item></item><item obtainable="0" type="mirror" inspected="0"><visible in="o desk"></visible><l> </l><o> </o><t> </t></item></item><item obtainable="0" type="bed" inspected="1"><visible in="unknown room"></visible><desc>The bed you woke up on.</desc><l>You look at the filthy bed trying not to be sick.</l><o>The bed is covered in filth.
