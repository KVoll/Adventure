I couldn't tell if my eyes were open or not. I rubbed my face and squinted harder to see. Eventually objects
emerged from the darkness and began to take familiar forms.  The first thing I laid my eyes on was
a door on the other side of the room.  It looked aged and rugged, but it was screaming my name.</intro><tip>

It's clear that this is not my journal.
                   I wonder who wrote in it.</l><o>I started to go through the journal and saw a lot of meaningless things written.  It seems like the
                  owner was a scientist of sorts.  It wasn't until I got to the last page that I saw something
                  interesting.  It reads,

                                           "WANT OUT OF HERE?
                                           Use this:
                                           { m b w y m f e n }
                </o><t>I take the journal for future reference.</t><item obtainable="1" type="picture" inspected="0"><visible in="journal"></visible><l>My gaze focused in on the picture attached to the mirror on the desk. There's a man, a woman, and
                          a little boy posing for a happy picture. Unfortunately, I don't know who the two boys are. At
                          that moment my eyes shifted to the mirror and realized that the woman in the picture is me. I
                          took a moment to inspect the picture further and found something strange on the back. There was a
                          small note stuck to it that said, "keyword is SALT". As if I know what that means. This place,
                          wherever it is, is eerie. This is not my home, why do they have a picture of me? Suddenly my
                          urge to get out of has increased.
