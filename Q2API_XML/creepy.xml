    <intro>
        Consciousness slowly returns to you after a very unnatural slumber. You feel your eyes open as panic sends your
        mind into an adrenaline fueled search of your last memory. You take deep breaths trying to calm yourself from
        the initial flood of panic. As your mind races you slowly come to terms that you have no recollection of the
        events that transpired before you woke. In fact, you fail to remember anything. Your eyes dart around the room
        in an attempt to find some kind of solution to the riddle of where and who you are.

    <room name="unknown room">
        <desc>        The room is completely foreign to you.  There's no telling how long you've been unconscious. Days? Weeks?\n
        Months?  You're uncertain.  The only choice you have is to try to find answers.  Try to find a way out.  The\n
        truly unfortunate thing is that your capabilities are rendered.  You only know how to look, open, and take\n
        the artifacts around you.  The first thing you do is carefully inspect your surroundings.\n
        There's a bookshelf, the bed that you woke up on, a large metal door, and a desk.\n
        </desc>
        <l>You notice that the room is furnished with dusty antiques.  The only light source is coming from thin
                 paneled windows with bars on them.  You take a moment to get more familiar with the room you're in.</l>
        <o>You go to the metal door and try to escape.  To no surprise, the metal door is locked.  For a moment you
              contemplated the possibility of the windows being a way out.  It's not long before you realize that even if
              you got the bars off, you wouldn't fit through the tiny slit anyway.  Ultimately, your attempts to open the
              room have failed.</o>
        <t>Knowing how to perform only three actions must be taking it's toll on your intelligence.  After hours of
              struggling with your pockets you finally come to the conclusion that your pants were made too tight to fit a
              room inside of them. You give up, and stop trying to take the room.</t>
        <item type="desk" obtainable="0" inspected="0">
            <history point="1" on="l desk">&lt;You found a history point!  Score increased by 1.&gt;</history>
            <visible in="unknown room"/>
            <l>The desk is aged and brittle probably made out of wood.  You're afraid to touch it in fear it might fall
                  apart.  Dust and thick spiderwebs are covering the surface.  It must have been here for a long time to
                  collect that much buildup.  You start to fade away into a daydream, and for a moment everything goes black.
                  When the light reappears, you notice you've drawn a symbol into the dust.  You stare at it until the image
                  is etched in your mind.
            </l>
            <o>You hesitated for a moment because the thing feels unsteady.  The last thing you want is for it to fall
               apart.  Whoever has kept you here might be upset.  Who DOES have you here, you wonder.  Eventually you
               opened the drawers slowly as the desk trembled.</o>
            <t>Your attempts are futile, poor thing.  The second you got your arms around it the whole thing shifted and
              almost fell on top of you.  You're lucky you're still alive.</t>

                <l>The journal is old, falling apart at its seams.  You don't remember having seen this item before, but
                you're eyes are focused on the symbol engraved in the leather.  It appears to be the as the one that
                appeared on the desk.</l>
                <o>I started to go through the journal and saw a lot of meaningless things written.  It seems like the
                  owner was a scientist of sorts.  It wasn't until I got to the last page that I saw something
                  interesting.  It reads,

                                                "WANT OUT OF HERE?
                                                 Use this:

                </o>
                <t>You take the journal hoping it will help lead to answers.</t>

                    <l>Your gaze focused in on the picture attached to the mirror on the desk. There's a man, a woman, and
                       a little boy posing for a happy picture. Unfortunately, I don't know who the two boys are. At
                       that moment my eyes shifted to the mirror and realized that the woman in the picture is me. YouI
                       took a moment to inspect the picture further and found something strange on the back. There was a
                       small note stuck to it that said, "keyword is SALT". As if you know what that means. This place,
                       wherever it is, is eerie. This is not my home, why do they have a picture of me? Suddenly my
                       urge to get out of has increased.
