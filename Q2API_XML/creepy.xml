DARKNESS
I can’t tell if my eyes are open or not. I rub my face and squint harder to see. Eventually objects
emerge from the darkness and begin to take familiar forms. As my eyes adjust my attention is suddenly directed
to a subtle yet foul odor in the room. Behind me is the only form of light in the room. The dim light cuts a
distinguishable perimeter of what must be another door. Thinking to myself, I quickly reason that another door
could mean a possibility of freedom…
