    <intro>
I couldn't tell if my eyes were open or not. I rubbed my face and squinted harder to see. Eventually objects
emerged from the darkness and began to take familiar forms.  The first thing I laid my eyes on was
a door on the other side of the room.  It looked aged and rugged, but it was screaming my name.</intro>

        <desc>&lt;This room is completely foreign to me.n&gt;</desc>
        <l>I inspected the room. It was a challenge to make my way around the room amongst all the chaos.</l>
        <o>Hmm... I don't thing that's going to work.  Let's see.
                               Nope. Try something else.</o>
        <t>I don't know how do that.</t>

            <l>The desk is aged and brittle.  I'm scared to touch it in fear</l>
            <o>You hesitated, but eventually opened the drawers slowly as they creaked.</o>
            <t>You wrap your arms around the desk and try to pick it up  You let go and decide to go on without taking the desk.</t>

                <l>The journal is old, falling apart, and covered in dust.  It's clear that this is not my journal.
                   I wonder who wrote in it.</l>
                <o>I started to go through the journal and saw a lot of meaningless things written.  It seems like the
                  owner was a scientist of sorts.  It wasn't until I got to the last page that I saw something
                  interesting.  It reads,

                                           "WANT OUT OF HERE?
                                           Use this:
                                           { m b w y m f e n }
                </o>
                <t>I take the journal for future reference.</t>

                    <visible in="journal"/>
                    <l>My gaze focused in on the picture attached to the mirror on the desk. There's a man, a woman, and
                          a little boy posing for a happy picture. Unfortunately, I don't know who the two boys are. At
                          that moment my eyes shifted to the mirror and realized that the woman in the picture is me. I
                          took a moment to inspect the picture further and found something strange on the back. There was a
                          small note stuck to it that said, "keyword is SALT". As if I know what that means. This place,
                          wherever it is, is eerie. This is not my home, why do they have a picture of me? Suddenly my
                          urge to get out of has increased.
